          	<h2>First Workshop on Software Challenges to Exascale Computing</h2>
          	<h3>December 21, 2017, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.</h3>
          	<h3> Overview</h3>
          	
          	<p>Supercomputing or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines (such as, astrophysics, archaeology, and financial trading). However, just provisioning HPC platforms is not very meaningful if the applications running on these platforms are not scalable and capable of fully utilizing their power. Writing scalable and performant software that can use these platforms effectively is critical for the sustained advancement of the field of supercomputing/HPC, and, to stay internationally competitive in science and technology. While the market is oversaturated with software engineers skilled at web-based technologies, there is a shortfall of workforce trained at developing performant HPC applications. Therefore, there is a need to motivate the workforce in selecting the less travelled territory of HPC software development. The HPC community can also leverage the research in the advanced software engineering discipline - such as, generative programming techniques, compiler design, refactoring tools, and model-driven engineering - to develop high-productivity tools and environments. Without bringing together the researchers and practitioners from the HPC and advanced software engineering communities, it will be a tough task to prepare people and applications for the exascale computing era. </p>
          	<p>The goal of the first workshop on “Software Challenges to Exascale Computing” is to foster international collaborations across the supercomputing and advanced software engineering disciplines. The workshop attendees will learn about the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the area of "software engineering for HPC", through presentations, hands-on sessions, and open-discussion sessions. By providing hands-on training to the interested participants, the workshop will also contribute towards the workforce development initiatives of the Indian and the US governments. As its broader impact, the workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack. Those already skilled in the advanced software engineering discipline will learn about the challenges and opportunities in the HPC domain. By fostering cross-disciplinary associations, the workshop will serve as a stepping stone towards innovations in future.  </p>
          	<p>
Benefits to HPC hardware vendors: understand the evolving needs of the HPC community, and network with potential customers. <br> <br>

Benefits to HPC service providers: understand the challenges that the community faces in using the HPC platforms efficiently, and connect with the user-community. <br><br>

Benefits to HPC researchers and users in the academia: disseminate your results to the public, and find potential collaborators. <br> <br>

Benefits to HPC software developers: understand the future trends in the HPC hardware and develop collaborations in the code modernization and optimization disciplines. <br> <br>

Benefits to students: network with HPC and advanced software engineering professionals and researchers, learn about internship and career opportunities, discuss the opportunities for higher education.
