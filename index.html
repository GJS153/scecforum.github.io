          	<h2>First Workshop on Software Challenges to Exascale Computing</h2>
          	<h3>December 21, 2017, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.</h3>
          	<h3> Overview</h3>
          	
          	<p>Supercomputing or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines (such as, astrophysics, archaeology, and financial trading). However, just provisioning HPC platforms is not very meaningful if the workforce is not prepared to utilize the platforms effectively. Writing scalable and performant software that can use these platforms effectively is therefore critical for the sustained advancement of the field of supercomputing/HPC, and, to stay internationally competitive in science and technology. The software engineering community, on the other hand, has specialized skills in the area of developing high-level tools for code refactoring, generative programming, and compiler design. Therefore, there is a need to bring together the researchers and practioners from the HPC and advanced software engineering communites to solve the challenges to the exascale computing.</p>
          	<p>The goal of the first workshop on “Software Challenges to Exascale Computing” is to foster international collaborations across the supercomputing and advanced software engineering disciplines. The workshop attendees will learn about the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in the area of software engineering for HPC through presentations, hands-on sessions, and open-discussion sessions. By providing hands-on training to the interested participants, the workshop will also contribute towards the workforce development initiatives of the Indian and the US government. As its broader impact, the workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack.</p>
          	<p>
Benefits to HPC hardware vendors: understand the evolving needs of the HPC community, and network with potential customers. <br> <br>

Benefits to HPC service providers: understand the challenges that the community faces in using the HPC platforms efficiently, and connect with the user-community. <br><br>

Benefits to HPC researchers and users in the academia: disseminate your results to the public, and find potential collaborators. <br> <br>

Benefits to HPC software developers: understand the future trends in the HPC hardware and develop collaborations in the area of code modernization and optimization. <br? <br>

Benefits to students: network with HPC and advanced software engineering professionals and researchers, learn about internship and career opportunities, discuss the opportunities for higher education.
